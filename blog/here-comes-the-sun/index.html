  <p>I spend too much of my life sitting alone in an office working on my conputer or looking at my smartphone. My regular dose of fresh air comes from my bike - I ride to work and back regularly - but I also enjoy getting out into the garden when I can. Trouble is, I dont really <em>enjoy</em> gardening! I do get a lot  of satisfaction from pruning the trees and shrubs, especially if it involves some climbing and as a result we now have an enormous pile of branches, leaves and twigs in the bottom of the garden. I recently found a new activity which satisfies my creative side and starts to diminish the stack o' cuttings : building 'dead hedge' style walls and fences.</p>

<p>First I sharpen a set of stakes and drive them into the ground, then I weave branches beween the stakes and finally I stuff twigs and leaves between the branches.  I always end up full of splinters with a big grin on my face.</p>
