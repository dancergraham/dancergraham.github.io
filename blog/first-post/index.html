          <p>I have had a few ideas for content to share recently and wanted a good way to do so.  I wanted to find a good solution for blog publishing with a few criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built using Python, editable in markdown so I can develop my skills.</li>
<li>Simple to build and maintain - I am not a web developer and have no desire to become one.  That said, I have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010520155249/http://www.fortunecity.co.uk/madchester/latin/336/">building websites</a> on an amateur basis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202092552/http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/union/susoc/ftc/">since the 1990s</a> so I'm not afraid of writing a little html if I have to.</li>
<li>Capable of incorporating Jupyter Notebooks</li>
<li>Simple to deploy, preferably for free.  I am hoping to do this via my internet provider but might go via GitHub failing that or even pay for a small cloud server.</li>
<li>No initial need for interractive content.</li>
</ul>
<p>I saw that the static site generators Pelican and Lektor were available.  That sounds like a good solution as it should be quick and have few moving parts which could break.  <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a> looked simple, welcoming and modern enough so I downloaded and installed it. I listened to <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/160/lektor-beautiful-websites-out-of-flat-files">Talk Python episode 160</a> as I did so and that encouraged me that I was on a good path.</p>
<blockquote><audio preload="none" controls="" id="direct_player">

                                </audio><p><em>Listen to Talk Python Episode 160 - Lektor (2018)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My initial experience has been great - I got going with no problem except that at the time of writing I have been waiting over a week for free to get around to setting up my personal web space so I can deploy the site.  At least that has given me enough time to configure a basic blog and write my first 2 posts.</p>
<h4>Post-deployment update</h4>
<p>OK so I have gone for GitHub pages for hosting with a custom web domain - buying the domain name and <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/docs/deployment/ghpages/#cname-support">specifying it in Lektor</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">in GitHub pages</a> was enough to get it working properly with https - no need to update certificates every few months !</p>
