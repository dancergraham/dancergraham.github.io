          <p>There's an old European folk tale of a man going into a village and asking for a pot and some water so he can make stone soup. Intrigued, the villagers give him a pot and some water and he boils it up. After a while he tastes it and says "not bad but it could use some onion - do you have some leftovers". The villagers give him a bit of onion and a few herbs whilst they are at it. It carries on like this until he has a delicious soup and the villagers are amazed that he did all that with just a pot of water and a stone.</p>
<p>I love Copilot, Claude and all the good things but the iterations of GitHub issues, suggested actions, debugging and fixing in the newer tool previews often taste suspiciously like stone soup 😅 🪨🍲 .</p>
