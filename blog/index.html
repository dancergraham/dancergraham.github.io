  <p>My version of YAGNI - "You Ain't Gonna Need It" - is a rule of three: only spend time refactoring your code when you have repeated yourself 3 times. Don't aim for truly DRY code devoid of all repetition.</p>
<p>I'm not saying not to apply SOLID design principles from the start - I definitely try to separate concerns, giving a single responsibility to a class or function and avoid, for instance, a single method handling file reading, data transformation and reporting.  This simplicity will make it much easier to refactor the code later.</p>
<p>I am saying to avoid using sophisticated design patterns, architecture or abstractions before you have used of your code enough to know what is likely to change (and require encapsulation) and what will stay constant (creating a useful abstraction).</p>
<h2>My recipe for success</h2>
<ol>
<li>Write simple code, leaning on the <strong>S</strong> from SOLID - separating code into small logical blocks</li>
<li>When you find yourself repeating the same code 3 times, refactor it into a function or class</li>
<li>Yes <strong>3.</strong> When you have <strong>3</strong> sufficiently different examples of the same pattern, reach for design patterns and modularisation.  Have fun. Don't be afraid to delete your existing code and start again using all you have learned. </li>
</ol>

  <p>I love The Zen of Python - one of the delights of the language is typing <code>import this</code> in a REPL and discovering this gem:</p>

  <p>In our team we started with the smallest possible shareable system - a flags namespace in our front-end code. We later adopted an existing open source library in the back end.  This got me thinking - what is the smallest possible feature flag system?</p>
<p><img src="feature-flags-pt-2-start-small/640px-Britains_Deetail_Waterloo_British_Officer_with_Sword_and_Flag.jpg" alt="Britains Deetail Waterloo British Officer with Sword and Flag by Sclight"></p>
<p>Here's a Hello World example...</p>
<h3>The world without flags</h3>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># greet.py</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Let's test it:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="go">python -m greet</span>
<span class="go">Hello, world!</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Add a flag</h3>
<p>I have a great idea for a new flagship feature - the script will ask the user's name and greet them personally!</p>
<p>What's the easiest way to add feature flags to a python script? 
For demonstration purposes we will just add a command line argument but this could be done 
with an environment variable or by looking at the user id or configuration.
We put the flag-specific code inside an if-statement and keep common code outside the flagged block:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># greet1.py</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>

<span class="n">personal_flag</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;personal&quot;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argv</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">personal_flag</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">greeted</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;What&#39;s your name? &quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">greeted</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;World&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">greeted</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Let's run this new feature up the flagpole and see who salutes:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="go">&gt; python -m greet1</span>
<span class="go">Hello, world!</span>
<span class="go">&gt; python -m greet1 personal</span>
<span class="go">What&#39;s your name? Graham</span>
<span class="go">Hello, Graham!</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Remove the flag</h3>
<p>I love this feature, the team loves it - we have tested it in production by activating the flag and our users love it too. 
Now it's time to remove the flag and tidy up the code:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># greet2.py</span>
<span class="n">greeted</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;What&#39;s your name? &quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">greeted</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That's much cleaner - glad I removed the feature flag!  Testing it...</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="go">&gt; python -m greet2</span>
<span class="go">What&#39;s your name? Graham</span>
<span class="go">Hello, Graham!</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Perfect!</p>

  <p>The greatest accelerator of my team's work last year was adopting feature flags. With flags we ship features faster, more confidently and with less stress. We have fewer merge conflicts despite frequently working together on the same part of the code base.</p>
<p><img src="feature-flags-pt-1-whats-so-great-about-feature-flags/Sbandieratori_3.JPG" alt="Men in colourful mediaeval costumes throwing huge flags into the air in a central Italian flagged square, thousands of onlookers in the background"></p>
<p><em>Saracen Joust in Arezzo: Exhibition of the flag-wavers from Archivio Istituzione Giostra del Saracino del Comune di Arezzo</em></p>
<p>In this post I will share the advantages and potential pain points we have seen. For context we are a team of 5 developers working together on a back end api and front end web app for business users. We have moved towards <strong>trunk-based development</strong>, avoiding long-running branches.</p>
<h3>What are Feature Flags ?</h3>
<p>A feature flag lets you turn parts of your code on or off for some or all users, or based on other conditions such as date, time, region, etc.</p>
<p>✅ In this post I am talking about short-lived flags used during development.</p>
<p>❌ I am not talking about permanent aspects of your app such as customisations for individuals or groups of users.</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fewer merge conflicts 🎌</strong>. This is the biggest plus: Hiding features which are incomplete or not yet launched behind a flag lets you merge more frequently safe in the knowledge that the new feature is not going to break existing code. By sharing more often, avoiding long-running branches, you hugely reduce the risk of big merge conflicts</li>
<li><strong>Earlier collaboration 🏳️‍🌈</strong>. Sharing your code earlier means you can start collaborating quickly with other developers, product, sales and designers. There is nothing better for discussion and collaboration than working code.</li>
<li><strong>Early feedback</strong>. By turning on features for trusted customers and partners you can get early feedback on the design and functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Increased productivity</strong>. All of this means you are shipping impactful changes earlier with less wasted effort. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Pain points</h3>
<p>Sounds too good to be true?  There is no such thing as a free lunch - here are some possible downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upfront investment</strong> It takes time to develop a feature flag system or adopt an external solution and you need to convince the team that the effort is worth it. I hope this blog post helps with that! Adopting feature flags may imply changes to your branching, code review, deployment and ci / cd system. </li>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong> Each flag adds a new code path - be wary of layering complexity or nesting flags in complex ways. Creating, updating and deleting each flag takes time so do not add them unnecessarily for small features.</li>
<li><strong>Removal</strong> At some point the flag code needs to be removed. Avoid keeping unused features behind deactivated flags or accepted features inside permanently active flags "just in case".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start small</strong> In our team we started with the smallest possible shareable system - a flags namespace in our front-end code. We later adopted an existing open source library in the back end.</li>
<li><strong>Work together</strong>. Ensure that everyone is adopting the system where appropriate, discuss any challenges as a team and look for solutions. Change course as necessary. </li>
</ul>

  </p>
  <p>People often say that in Python you should use exceptions - "Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission" (EAFP) over guard clauses - "Look Before You Leap" (LBYL), but the Result design pattern - returning an object which explicitly states whether the operation succeeded is a useful alternative where error handling is required and, as I learned by exploring in more depth, it can be compatible with both approaches.</p>
<p>As my <a href="https://github.com/dancergraham/HeadFirstDesignPatterns_python">design patterns repo</a> approaches <code>100⭐</code> on GitHub I decided to add the <a href="https://github.com/dancergraham/HeadFirstDesignPatterns_python/tree/main/extra_result">Result design pattern</a> to the mix</p>
<h2>EAFP vs LBYL</h2>
<p>or <em>Graham plays with GitHub Code Search</em></p>
<p>Prompted by <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@CodenameTim/113730836308245068">a post on Mastodon</a>
I looked a bit more into which patterns people are using for error handling
specifically for attribute lookup: I'm surprised to see twice as many
references to <a href="https://github.com/search?type=code&amp;auto_enroll=true&amp;q=hasattr+language%3APython">hasattr</a>
as for <a href="https://github.com/search?type=code&amp;auto_enroll=true&amp;q=except+AttributeError+language%3APython+">"except AttributeError"</a></p>
<p>and not only for dynamic lookups but also for general attribute search, so a win for LBYL vs EAFP style with Python, despite the latter often being recommended ?</p>

  <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I wrote a script to help me code in python and learn RhinoCommon and decided to share it with you 😜</p>
<p>As you may know, the rhinoscriptsyntax library is written in Python and uses rhinocommon functions, also in Python, under the hood. In order to look up the underlying code you can open up the full python file, you can use the inspect module or you can save the script below to your computer and run it each time you want to look up a particular function. For instance if you search for ‘bounding’ you get the following options:</p>
<p><img src="rhinopython-may-the-source-be-with-you/rhinopython_source_0.png" alt="Search and select dialog box for library function"></p>
<p>And by clicking on the 3rd option you get the underlying source code, which you can read in the box, copy elsewhere, …</p>

  <p>I spend too much of my life sitting alone in an office working on my conputer or looking at my smartphone. My regular dose of fresh air comes from my bike - I ride to work and back regularly - but I also enjoy getting out into the garden when I can. Trouble is, I dont really <em>enjoy</em> gardening! I do get a lot  of satisfaction from pruning the trees and shrubs, especially if it involves some climbing and as a result we now have an enormous pile of branches, leaves and twigs in the bottom of the garden. I recently found a new activity which satisfies my creative side and starts to diminish the stack o' cuttings : building 'dead hedge' style walls and fences.</p>
<p><img src="here-comes-the-sun/garden03.png" alt="garden03"></p>
<p><img src="here-comes-the-sun/garden02.png" alt="garden02"></p>
<p>First I sharpen a set of stakes and drive them into the ground, then I weave branches beween the stakes and finally I stuff twigs and leaves between the branches.  I always end up full of splinters with a big grin on my face.</p>

  <h3>Adding leading zeros with Python</h3>
<p>Various ways to add leading zeros to a number, for instance a wind direction, using Python.  <a href="any-way-the-wind-blows/wind_zeros.ipynb">Available as a Jupyter Notebook</a></p>
<h3>Generate a list of wind directions</h3>
<p>First some definitions. The wind direction is measured in degrees clockwise from north and represents the direction the wind is blowing <strong>from</strong>. For instance an easterly wind, i.e. wind blowing <strong>from</strong> the east has a direction of 90 degrees. Let's generate 16 wind directions from 0 (north) to 337.5 (north by northwest).</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">interval</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">22.5</span>  <span class="c1"># degrees</span>

<span class="go"> 337.5]</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>String zfill method</h3>
<p>No doubt the most pythonic way to add leading zeros to a bare string, the built-in <code>str.zfill()</code> method is designed to do just that.</p>

<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="go">    000 000.0</span>
<span class="go">    022 022.5</span>
<span class="go">    045 045.0</span>
<span class="go">    067 067.5</span>
<span class="go">    090 090.0</span>
<span class="go">    112 112.5</span>
<span class="go">    135 135.0</span>
<span class="go">    157 157.5</span>
<span class="go">    180 180.0</span>

<span class="go">    247 247.5</span>
<span class="go">    270 270.0</span>
<span class="go">    292 292.5</span>
<span class="go">    315 315.0</span>
<span class="go">    337 337.5</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We can immediately see our first quirk: the integer representation truncates decimal values rather than rounding up (as I learned to do at school) or rounding towards the nearest even number (<a href="https://realpython.com/python-rounding/">as the Python round() funtion would do</a>).</p>
<h3>String slicing</h3>
<p>Very fast and arguably even more readable for people with a good understanding of basic python syntax but no desire to read the docs or explore the obscure corners of the language. Add the maximum possible number of leading zeros and then slice the desired number of digits.</p>

<h3>Class</h3>
<p>By overloading the built-in <code>__str__()</code> method for the class we can create our own custom string representation of the value.</p>
