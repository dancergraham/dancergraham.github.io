          <p><a href="https://github.com/dancergraham?tab=overview&amp;from=2024-01-01&amp;to=2024-12-31">Looking back on 2024</a> here are some personal highlights:</p>
<h3>Maintaining an established pypi package 📦</h3>
<p>Early in 2024 I took over maintenance of the very useful <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pye57/">Python package pye57</a> for 
reading and writing e57 format pointcloud files. I have been using it at work for several years and was 
worried that it was not being maintained, blocking upgrade of our project to Python 3.11. 
I had already started working on an alternative library, cleverly titled <code>e57</code> - essentially I got in touch with 
the project maintainer, providing some evidence that I was a real human being not a sham account, 
many thanks to David Caron for creating the library and maintaining it for so many years, and for trusting
me to carry it on.</p>
<p>In the first 6 months 6 months I and other contributors ensured that pye57 now supports Python 11 and 12 
and macOS is now supported (on apple silicon only). There are 3 or 4 new contributors beside myself 
with a few bug fixes, quality of life improvements, photo writing, and an update to a more recent version of libe57Format
I closed 10+ issues and saw some engagement from past contributors in the issue tracker and PR comments. 
I once released broken wheels to pypi and reverted them within a few hours. Wheels are now tested in ci before release.</p>
<h3>Joining Jazzband 🎶🎷</h3>
<p>Looking for a <a href="../tags/feature-flags/">feature flags</a> library I came across <a href="https://waffle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Django Waffle</a>, 
which looked good but the ci tests were a couple of versions behind and the docs were broken and 
looked sparse and outdated, including some references to Django version 1!
I started contributing and after a rough start getting up to speed with other contributors' expectations of git workflow and
PR etiquette I made 9 contributions, mostly around the documentation and testing. 
This gave me enough confidence to adopt the library at work and I'm very happy with it so far.</p>
<h3>Meetups and events 📅🍕</h3>
<p>I continued contributing to the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nantes-python-meetup/">Nantes Python Meetup</a>, kicking off some
collaborations with other meetups in Nantes and I went to the Nantes React meetup twice as well, which was very nice. 
Unfortunately I couldn't make it to <a href="https://www.pycon.fr/2024/">PyCon France in 2024</a> but I submitted a proposal for DjangoCon Europe at the 
end of 2024 and I'm very happy to have <a href="https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/djangocon-europe-2025/talk/KNLFS8/">been accepted</a> and looking forward to visiting Dublin for the first time in 20
years.</p>
<h3>Advent of Code 🎄🧑🏻‍🎄</h3>
<p>I found the motivation and skilz to <a href="https://github.com/dancergraham/advent_of_code_2024/tree/main/advent_of_code_2024">solve roughly the first half</a> of the puzzles in this year's event. I was less motivated than in previous years but there were some fun challenges in there.</p>
<h3>Misc. ⁉️</h3>
<p>A few other highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributing HTTP Status Codes to the <a href="https://github.com/joke2k/faker">Faker library</a> having been surprised not to find them already in there.</li>
<li>Maintaining my rust-backed <a href="https://pypi.org/project/e57/">e57 Python library</a></li>
<li>Minor contribution to the upstream <a href="https://crates.io/crates/e57">e57 rust library</a></li>
<li>Adding e57 file support to a pointcloud visualisation library</li>
<li>Adding the Result design pattern to my <a href="https://github.com/dancergraham/HeadFirstDesignPatterns_python">Design Patterns repo</a></li>
</ul>
